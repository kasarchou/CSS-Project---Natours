## About

**Natours** is a learning-focused, static landing page project built with HTML, CSS, and SCSS to explore styling techniques, responsive layouts, and visual design principles.

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **SCSS** (for modular, maintainable styles)

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kasarchou/CSS-Project---Natours.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed if SCSS compilation or automated tooling is needed (otherwise, SCSS can be compiled manually).

3. (Optional) Install dependencies and run build scripts provided in `package.json`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build:css
   ```

4. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the page.

## Features & Learning Objectives

- Practice semantic HTML structure.
- Write and organize styles using SCSS.
- Understand core CSS concepts like layout, box model, and typography.
- Learn simple responsive design techniques (e.g. flex, grid, media queries).
- Explore core styling concepts: colors, transitions, spacing, and text styles.

---

## Usage

- Use this as a **learning exercise** to explore styling patterns.
- Customize styling (e.g. colors, layout tweaks) to see how visual changes reflect in design.
- Expand by making components reusable or adding interactivity using CSS pseudo‑classes.

---
## Development

During development in order to see the icons in localhost the corresponding import line of the icons must be added (it commented out). Also watch mode is suggested so that changes are reflected in real time
withou the need to refresh the browser tab.
